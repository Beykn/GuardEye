i've updated the violation upload mechanism to use queue, because previously it was uploading directly from the loop that runs the model
and that resulted in low FPS, cause the model was waiting for the violations to be uploaded, right now the violations are handeled seprately
by a queue so they don't block the model and the FPS is back to normal

i tried to use threads to upload the violations, a seprate thread for uploading the violations, but it was too slow cause we already has
alot of threads running(UI thread and model thread)
