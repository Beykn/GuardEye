i've updated the violations page for the admin panel, i've added some spaces between the cards and fixed the overflow for the delete button
i've added categories for the trips('Upcoming', 'Finished', 'All'), and now the driver can filter them and choose from the trips page
i've added end trip button, it will end the trip and add start and end time and the duration of the trip

TO DO:
the live_cam file is messy, it has a lot of code in it, refactor it
