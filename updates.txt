all the following changes were made to improve the performance of the code
passed the uid from login to userPage so we don't need to fetch it again
added a function to login and a loading state to the login page
changed the _userFromFirebase in auth file to only fetch the role not the whole user
removed trips array from getDriverData in database file so we don't need to fetch in that function, when we need it we can fetch it using the getDriverTrips functions
